Car Parking Sensor System by using Tiva Board with Assembly Codes

This project is written in ARM Cortex assembly language. The aim of this project is driving a motor with a distance sensor which simulates parking sensor system. If the threshold value is exceeded, motor should be stop. Also, threshold value can be changed by pressing SW1 on Tiva C Board. Nokia Screen shows the mod changes and status of system.


All connections and explanations for subroutines exist in "447_report.pdf" file.
SPI for Nokia LCD is also mentioned in this pdf.
